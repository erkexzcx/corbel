//! Z anti-aliasing.
//!
//! A layer is flat and the model it came from usually is not, so wherever the
//! surface of a part is shallower than about 45° the print leaves a staircase:
//! each tread is one layer's worth of surface laid at one height, and each
//! riser is the full layer height. The treads are what catch the light.
//!
//! This follows the surface across each tread instead, varying the height of
//! the extrusion within the layer by up to half a layer either way, and
//! metering each stretch for the gap it actually crosses. The staircase
//! becomes a ramp, and the ramps of consecutive layers meet exactly: one ends
//! half a layer above its plane where the next begins half a layer below its
//! own.
//!
//! Where the surface is comes from [`surface`](crate::zaa::surface), which reads it
//! off the outlines of the layers either side rather than off the model — a
//! post-processor is handed G-code and nothing else.
//!
//! It runs over the top surface, the ironing above it, and the **walls**. The
//! walls matter more than they sound: a slope of more than about ten degrees
//! leaves a tread narrower than the wall stack standing on it, so there is no
//! top-surface region at all and the staircase is made entirely of wall. The
//! visible one is always followed; the hidden ones are followed only when
//! [`brick`](crate::brick) is not running in the same pass, because the bead
//! under a hidden wall may be one bricking raised, and lowering onto it would
//! close a gap that was metered open.
//!
//! It is written as a [`Write`] that sits in front of the real one, so the two
//! transforms compose in a single pass over the file: `brick` writes its
//! output into this, and this writes the finished G-code out.

//! Where the model's own surface sits inside a layer, worked out from the
//! layers either side of it.
//!
//! A slicer takes its cross-section through the **middle** of a layer, so a
//! layer's outline is where the surface passes `plane - height/2` and the next
//! layer's outline is where it passes `plane + height/2`. Between the two —
//! the strip of a layer that nothing is printed over, which is exactly what
//! the slicer labels a top surface — the surface climbs from one to the other.
//! Following it there instead of laying the whole strip flat is what turns a
//! staircase into a ramp.
//!
//! Nothing here needs the model. The two outlines are already in the G-code,
//! as the cells each layer's extrusions pass through, and a linear climb
//! across the strip reproduces a flat slope **exactly** — which is the case
//! that stair-steps in the first place. What it cannot reproduce is a surface
//! that curves sharply inside one strip, and there it errs toward the plane.
//!
//! Two things have to be told apart from a slope, and both fall out of the
//! same arithmetic rather than being special-cased:
//!
//! - **A flat top.** Nothing is printed above it anywhere, so the strip has no
//!   far edge and no climb can be measured. Its width comes out unbounded and
//!   the rise fades to nothing.
//! - **A ledge with a wall standing on it.** The strip has a far edge, but the
//!   *near* edge is a vertical face rather than the surface crossing a plane,
//!   so there is no ramp to continue. The layer below says which it is: under
//!   a slope it reaches a strip's width further out, and under a vertical wall
//!   it stops in the same place.

/// Reads the pockets of `lower` that `upper` opens wider as air rather than
/// as something printed over.
///
/// A flood from the border cannot tell a bore from the interior of a part:
/// both are what the outline encloses, and neither is reachable from outside.
/// Calling both of them covered is deliberate and mostly right — a hollow
/// layer's interior is filled by infill laid at the same plane, so nothing
/// there is exposed to the air — but it swallows every upward-facing surface
/// around a hole. A countersink, a chamfered bore mouth or a funnel has a
/// **larger** hole on the layer above, so the tread between the two reads as
/// covered and is left as a step, and a countersunk screw hole shows its
/// staircase exactly as plainly as an outer slope does.
///
/// What separates them is whether the layer above encloses the same pocket or
/// opens it out. Three things have to hold at once, and each one refuses a
/// case the others let through:
///
/// - the pocket has to be hollow in `upper` **all the way across**,
/// - every cell **bordering** the pocket has to be hollow in `upper` too, so
///   that the pocket sits strictly inside a pocket of `upper` rather than
///   merely overlapping one, and
/// - `upper` has to carry it at least [`MOUTH_SLACK`] cells further.
///
/// The first is what makes this safe on sparse infill — which matters more
/// than the bug, because a rise written over infill is buried inside the part
/// where nothing can iron it flat. The gaps between one layer's infill lines
/// are crossed by the next layer's, so a pocket of `lower` is never wholly
/// hollow in `upper` unless `upper` really did print nothing over it. Where
/// the two layers' infill is identical, as a 2D honeycomb's is, the pocket is
/// hollow in `upper` and is not opened by a single cell, so the third refuses
/// it.
///
/// The second is what keeps a part's own interior out of this. A hole that
/// **narrows** upward leaves the layer above with one pocket where this layer
/// has two, so this layer's interior is contained in it and reads as opened
/// wider — but only by merging, and a merge shows at the border: the interior
/// is bounded by the outer wall as well, and the outer wall is printed on the
/// layer above too. Nesting is the property that means "opened out"; mere
/// containment is not. The same test refuses a hollow shell whose wall moves
/// inward, and accepts one whose wall moves outward, which is the right
/// answer for both.
///
/// Both members of a matched pair are carved, so the distance transforms read
/// the bore's own wall as the edge of the layer: the tread's low end is then
/// this layer's outline and its high end the layer above's, which is the same
/// climb as on any other slope, only facing inward.
///
/// `waist` and `tread` are what keep the three tests above honest on a real
/// slice, and both are the module's own arithmetic rather than a tolerance.
/// A pocket narrower than `waist` — one whole bead, in cells — is the gap the
/// rasterised centrelines left between two neighbouring beads and not a hole
/// at all, and a carry running further than `tread` — the widest strip the
/// transform follows, in cells — is a pocket sitting loose in a void rather
/// than a lip over a hole. Without them, measured on a 672-layer part sliced
/// at 15% gyroid with 0.42 mm beads: **2878 pockets accepted, half of them a
/// single cell across, carrying a median of 1301 rings** — 190 mm of claimed
/// tread — so 25.6 million cells of the layers above were carved out of
/// 66 thousand cells of pocket, the interior of the part read as an open
/// surface, and the walls buried inside it were followed and then printed
/// over. That is what `--zaa` re-metering a file by **+14.34%** looks like,
/// against the −0.71% the same file gives once a mouth has to be one.

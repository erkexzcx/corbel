//! would answer that, and would also make the memory this tool uses a function
//! of how tall the print is: a bed-filling layer is a few hundred thousand
//! cells, and there is no bound on how many layers a file has.
//!
//! So the file is read a second time instead, by a reader of its own that
//! never gets more than a layer or two in front. Three layers are held, which
//! is what the surface model compares, and the cost is one more pass over the
//! input rather than one more copy of it.

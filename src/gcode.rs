/// ceiling puts the whole input in one buffer whenever the input has none — a
/// file written with bare `\r` by classic Mac tooling, a binary blob that
/// reached the text path — and the lossy repair below then copies it again, so
/// peak memory becomes a multiple of the file rather than the flat cost this
/// tool promises.
///
/// The second is on meaning. A command a firmware will run is tens of bytes;
/// Marlin's own serial line buffer is 96, and everything past it is dropped
/// before the line is even queued. Every long line a slicer writes is a
/// comment instead — a config block, or a thumbnail, which arrives already
/// wrapped at around eighty characters — and the longest of them is a user's
/// start G-code copied into one comment, kilobytes at the very worst. Sixty
/// four kilobytes is therefore hundreds of times the longest command and many
/// times the longest comment, while three copies of it still cost less than a
/// quarter of the write buffer this crate already keeps.

/// side of a transform costs one line of memory however large the file is.

/// Terminators are stripped exactly as [`str::lines`] strips them, `\n` and
/// `\r\n`, so what a transform sees never depends on whether the G-code
/// arrived as a string or as a file. A bare `\r` is deliberately **not** one.
/// Marlin ends a line on it and Klipper does not, so splitting there would
/// turn the tail of a comment a Klipper print ignores into commands it obeys;
/// and [`Survey::of`](crate::scan::Survey::of) reads an in-memory file with
/// [`str::lines`], so recognising one here alone would leave the two passes
/// disagreeing about where the lines of a file are.

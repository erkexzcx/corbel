"""The bead model the diagrams are drawn from, mirrored from `src/brick.rs`.

Nothing here is a drawing convenience. Every function is the Python twin of a
Rust one, so a diagram cannot show a wall the binary would not produce:

    bead_spacing   <- brick::bead_spacing
    flow_ceiling   <- brick::flow_ceiling
    automatic_flow <- brick::automatic_flow
    rise           <- Pass::rise_at
    offsets        <- Pass::offset / Pass::rise_of, over a whole column
    skin_offset    <- Pass::skin_offset
    raised_loops   <- Pass::number_loops, for the simple monotonic case

`pin.py` next to this file checks them against the Rust, so a change on either
side that drifts is caught rather than drawn.
